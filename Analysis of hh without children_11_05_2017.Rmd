#Research Question:
Fitting several IRT  models on the Food Security Scale to assess:

1) Which model has better fit between: 
    a) unconstrained Rasch Model
    b) constrained Rasch Model
    c) Two Parameter Logistic Model

2) Can we obtain significantly different cut-off points using the best model?

2) If the model shows a good fit, do we have parameter invariance between Mexico´s and U.S. scales?

##Food Security Scale
Data from the Current Population Survey - December of 2016

##How is the survey conducted?

####Screening question - not used for food security measure and so not used for this analysis:

 - HESS1 = i1 

Which of these statements best describes the food eaten in your household in the last 12 months: we always have enough to eat and the kinds of food we want; we have enough to eat but not always the kinds of food we want; sometimes we don't have enough to eat; or often we don't have enough to eat?

####Some considerations about the data:

- For the often true/sometimes true/never true items, they are recorded as follows:

recoded as 1 if "Often true" or "Sometimes true" and 0 if "Never true" 

- For the yes/no items, they are recorded as follows: 

recoded as 1 if "Yes" and 0 if "No" 

- For the almost every month/some months but not every month/only 1 or 2 months items they were recoded as follows: 

recoded as 1 if "every month" or "some months but not every month" and 0 if "only 1 or 2 months" 


- The rawscore that comes along the data set from the survey does not match my generated rawscore in 264 cases, I decided to exclude these cases from the analyisis until I figure out what´s going on here.

- The households with no information are also excluded from the analysis (29,192 cases ehich represent 22.6% of the whole sample)

```

####Testing several models just using the 8 items (no follow ups)

1) Fit a Rasch Model. Rasch models are also known as one parameter models. It assumes that the guessing and the discrimination parameter are the same across items:

In this case we are fitting an unconstrained and a constrained Rasch Model with:

  $\alpha_i=2$ $\forall i$ ??? - this was just for the graphs, but how do you establish it??
  
  $c_i=0$ $\forall i$

2) Fit a Two Parameter Model, in this case the model estimates the discrimination parameter for each item, but $c_i=0$ $\forall i$

####Rasch Model

```{r}

#Fit a Rasch model - hessian matrix is non-positive!!! None of these work
#fit.rasch<-rasch(items2)
#summary(fit.rasch)
#fit.rasch <- tpm(items2, type = "rasch", constraint = cbind(1:8, 3, 1))
#summary(fit.rasch)

#Constraint? - this fits better? In order to impose the constraint alpha, the constraint argument is used. This argument accepts a two-column matrix where the first column denotes the parameter and the second column indicates the value at which the corresponding parameter should be fixed.
fit.rasch<-rasch(items2, constraint=cbind(8+1,1))
summary(fit.rasch)

#Margins?? - we don´t want´t the chi-square to be significant
margins(fit.rasch)
margins(fit.rasch, type="three-way")

#Goodness of fit cannot be computed with unconstrained model?? - null hypothesis states that the observed data have been generated under the Rasch model with the parameter values the maximum likelihood estimates.
#GoF.rasch(fit.rasch, B = 100)

#Residuals
#plot residuals vs ability to test homoscedasticity??
res.rasch<-residuals(fit.rasch)

#Factor scores
fs.rasch<-factor.scores(fit.rasch)
#plot(fs.rasch)

#ICC and information curves
par(lwd=2)
plot(fit.rasch, legend = TRUE, cx = "left", cex.main = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.5, cex = 1.5)
plot(fit.rasch, type = "IIC", annot = FALSE, cex.main = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.5)
plot(fit.rasch, type = "IIC", items = 0, cex.main = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.5)

```




####2PL Model

```{r}

#Fit a 2PL model - up to two latent variables with names z1 and z2
#I changed the number of quadrature points in order to get coefficients more similar to the mirt package??
fit.2pl<-ltm(items2~z1, IRT.param = T, control=list(GHk = 61, iter.qN = 50))

summary(fit.2pl)

#Margins - is this due to sample size??
margins(fit.2pl)
margins(fit.2pl, type="three-way")

#Compare the fit of the Rasch Model vs the 2PL Model - is this a better fit??
anova(fit.rasch, fit.2pl)

#Residuals
#plot residuals vs ability to test homoscedasticity??
res.2pl<-residuals(fit.2pl)

#Factor scores - is the lack of a normal distribution here a problem??
fs.2pl<-factor.scores(fit.2pl)
#plot(fs.2pl)

#ICC and informaction curves
par(lwd=2)
plot(fit.2pl, legend = TRUE, cx = "left", cex.main = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.5, cex = 1.5)
plot(fit.2pl, type = "IIC", annot = FALSE, cex.main = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.5)
plot(fit.2pl, type = "IIC", items = 0, cex.main = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.5)

item.fit(fit.2pl, G = 4, FUN = mean)

```


####Analysis with 'mirt' package

Since we need to include the survey weights in this analysis, it was decided to use the mirt package, which allows survey weights. 

```{r}

#Rasch model
fit.r <- mirt(items2, model=1, itemtype='Rasch')
fit.rw <- mirt(items2, model=1, itemtype='Rasch', survey.weights = dat$weighth)

#2Pl model
fit.2 <- mirt(items2, model=1, itemtype='2PL')
fit.2w <- mirt(items2, model=1, itemtype='2PL', survey.weights = dat$weighth)

#Extract the discrimination parameters
ext.coef<-function(model, k) {
a <- coef(model, as.data.frame=T)
a[seq(k,length(a),4)]
a[c(1:8)]
}

qplot(x=ext.coef(fit.r,2), y=ext.coef(fit.rw,2), main="Difficulty parameters Rasch", xlab="No weights", ylab="Weights") + geom_line()
qplot(x=ext.coef(fit.2,1), y=ext.coef(fit.2w,1), main="Discrimination parameters 2PL", xlab="No weights", ylab="Weights") + geom_line()


```


```{r}

#Comparing discrimination parameter using ltm vs mirt (no weighting)
#First we fit the 2PL model using the mirt package
fit.2pl.mirt <- mirt(items2, model=1, itemtype='2PL')
coef(fit.2pl.mirt, simplify=T)

#Using mirt and survey weights
fit.2pl.mirtw <- mirt(items2, 1, itemtype='2PL', survey.weights = dat$weighth)

fit.2pl
fit.2pl.mirt
fit.2pl.mirtw

disc.ltm <- c(6.3415, 6.3599, 4.5101, 7.3436, 8.3184, 6.7368, 5.4509, 5.0711)
disc.mirt <- c(6.887, 6.878, 4.729, 7.78, 8.715, 7.052, 5.56, 5.163)
disc.mirtw <- c(7.031, 7.322, 4.856, 7.790, 8.616, 7.009, 5.536, 5.134)

qplot(x=disc.ltm, y=disc.mirt, main="Discrimination par´s", xlab="ltm", ylab="mirt") + geom_line()

qplot(x=disc.mirt, y=disc.mirtw, main="Discrimination par´s", xlab="No survey weights", ylab="Using survey weights") + geom_line()

```

#### Aalysis with weights

```{r}

fit.rasch.final <- mirt(items2, model=1, itemtype='Rasch', survey.weights = dat$weighth)
fit.2pl.final <- mirt(items2, model=1, itemtype='2PL', survey.weights = dat$weighth)

anova(fit.rasch.final, fit.2pl.final)  

#ICC´s
plot(fit.rasch.final, type = 'trace')
plot(fit.2pl.final, type = 'trace')

```
